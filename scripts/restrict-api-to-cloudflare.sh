# SEC-4.1, the Azure half: let only the Cloudflare edge reach the production API.
#
# Why it matters. The API trusts `CF-Connecting-IP` (`Security:ClientIp:Header` in
# appsettings.Production.json) to know who is calling. While the App Service answers everyone, the
# default `*.azurewebsites.net` hostname is an open door: a request sent straight there can carry
# any `CF-Connecting-IP` it likes, and with it walk past the login rate limit, the geo block and
# the address written into the audit log.
#
#   bash scripts/restrict-api-to-cloudflare.sh          # close the perimeter
#   bash scripts/restrict-api-to-cloudflare.sh undo     # open it again
#
# Cloudflare publishes its ranges at cloudflare.com/ips-v4 and /ips-v6 and changes them rarely;
# rerun this after such a change. Staging is deliberately not touched: its frontend calls the App
# Service hostname directly, with no Cloudflare in front, so the same rules would cut it off.
